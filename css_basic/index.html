  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This is a simple webpage created as part of an HTML learning exercise. It demonstrates basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and images.</p>

  <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
  <p>Through this project, I'm learning to structure HTML documents properly, use semantic tags, and embed media and links effectively.</p>

  <p>The page includes different heading levels to organize the content, as well as several paragraphs to provide enough context for each section.</p>

  <p>Finally, Iâ€™ve included a clickable image that links to the ALX website as part of this assignment. You can click the logo below to visit the ALX site.</p>
